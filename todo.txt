- write a Term class (TermImp) that implements the Term interface
- write a Polynomial class (PolynomialImp) that implements the Polynomial interface


custom:
- CHECK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CREATE A EMPTY POLYNOMIAL

- check the changeCapacityMethods especially in remove
- do we need to use iterator?
- verify all error messages
- optimize all enhanced for loops for size only
- check if the poly is zero (0)
- what happens if (10x+5x) is the polynomial?
- verify poly 0 on toString
- what if it's another variable then "x"
- what if there is a negative
- what if we add two empty polynomials
- maybe take out the P1n and P2n when it isn't necessary
